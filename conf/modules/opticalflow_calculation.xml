	Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement of object or camera. It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second. 
	 - We will understand the concepts of optical flow and its estimation using Lucas-Kanade method.
	 - We will use functions like cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK() to track feature points in a video.

	By adding this module to your flightplan and flying in the cyberzoo with the flightplan TUDELFT/tudelft_course2016_avoid_orange_cyberzoo.xml you will avoid every obstacle that is orange.
