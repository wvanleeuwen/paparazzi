<!DOCTYPE flight_plan SYSTEM "flight_plan.dtd">
<!--
The goal of this flightplan is to have a safe, simple no-brainer flightplan for your first AR drone tryout flights.
It should be useable for UAS enthousiasts just starting in the field of autonomous AR Drone flights.
This flightplan should be kept as simple as possible and *not* to be extended with more functionality, if one needs that, plz use another flightplan.
-->
